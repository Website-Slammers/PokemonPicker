[array]  [pokemon chosen]


object(all pokemon and victory points)
{
    pokemonVictoryObject (1) ={
        
        wins = 1,
        losses = 2,
        median = -1,
        opponentsBeat = [125],
        opponentsLost = [34, 63],
        number = 039,
        pokemonObj(

        )
    }
}


what the project still needs
iterative counting for wins and losses not just replacing the values
not show the same pokemon ever;
